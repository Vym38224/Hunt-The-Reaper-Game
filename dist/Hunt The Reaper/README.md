-----------------------------------------------   ABOUT ME   ---------------------------------------------------

This is my own project. I did it in my leisure time. To get some experience in python.
I am only a beginner and I know that the project is not perfect and the code is unnecessarily long.
I may come back to Hunt The Reaper in the future and improve it. Thanks for trying the game and any feedback.
Have a fun time :D.
