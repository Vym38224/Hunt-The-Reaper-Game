# Hunt The Reaper

## Introducion
"Hunt The Reaper" is a Python game project I developed to gain experience with Python programming.
Although I'm still a beginner and the code may be a bit lengthy and imperfect, this project was a valuable learning experience.
I plan to revisit and improve it in the future.

## Requirements
To run "Hunt The Reaper", you'll need to have Python installed on your system, as well as the pygame and random library.
You can install the necessary libraries using pip.
